---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### üí° First Things to Try

**Run `./control_panel.sh` ‚Üí Select "4" (Check Environment)**

This will help you diagnose the problem.

---

### Problem 1: "Bluetooth adapter not found" or "Cannot connect"

**Solution**:

1.  **From the Control Panel**
    -   Run `./control_panel.sh` ‚Üí Select "3" (Restart Bluetooth).

2.  **Or Manually**
    ```bash
    # Run in terminal
    sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
    sleep 3
    hciconfig
    ```
    If you see `UP RUNNING`, you're good to go.

3.  **Check your Switch**
    -   Ensure the "Change Grip/Order" screen is open on your Switch.
    -   Disconnect all other controllers.

---

### Problem 2: The ENTER or CTRL+Y keys don't work

**Cause**: The terminal window is not in focus.

**Solution**:
1.  Click on the terminal window where the macro is running to select it.
2.  Press ENTER or CTRL+Y.

---

### Problem 3: The macro won't stop

**Solution**:

1.  **From the Control Panel**
    -   Run `./control_panel.sh` ‚Üí Select "2" (Stop Macro).

2.  **Or Manually**
    ```bash
    # Run in terminal
    sudo pkill -f switch_macro.py
    ```

---

### Problem 4: "Permission denied" error

**Cause**: Trying to run a script without `sudo` (administrator privileges).

**Solution**:
Always use `./control_panel.sh` to start the macro. This script handles `sudo` correctly internally.

---

### Problem 5: Errors like "nxbt: command not found"

**Cause**: Python's virtual environment is not activated.

**Solution**:
Always use `./control_panel.sh` to start the macro. This script automatically activates the virtual environment for you.

## üîß Customization (For Advanced Users)

### Editing the Macro

Open `src/switch_macro.py` in a text editor and modify the following section:

```python
    def execute_macro(self):
        """
        Executes the macro.
        Press ZL -> Add A after 0.2s -> Release all after 0.5s.
        """
        try:
            # Macro definition: Simultaneous presses are separated by spaces.
            # Format: "BUTTON1 BUTTON2 DURATION" or just "DURATION" (for waiting).
            macro_sequence = (
                "ZL 0.2s\n"      # Press ZL for 0.2s
                "ZL A 0.5s\n"    # Press ZL and A simultaneously for 0.5s
                "0.1s"           # Release all buttons and wait for 0.1s
            )

            # Send the macro (block=True waits for completion).
            self.nxbt.macro(
                self.controller_index,
                macro_sequence,
                block=True
            )

            return True

        except Exception as e:
